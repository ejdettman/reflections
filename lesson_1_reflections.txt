How did viewing a diff between two versions 
of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It saved you the time of scanning through unchanged lines.




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Will save you from having to manually store old versions yourself.




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros are that each commit has logic behind it
Cons are that version control requires the user to commit




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because files are usually inter-related in programming




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all of the commits with the notes, use git diff to get the exact changes between commits




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Can checkout previous commits to track bugs




Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Become comfortable with backing up projects on github
